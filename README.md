Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts
of the body controlled by the nerves.
The most prominent signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease occur when nerve cells in
the **basal ganglia**, an area of the brain that controls movement, become **impaired and/or
die**. Normally, these nerve cells, or neurons, produce an important brain chemical know as
**dopamine**. When the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine, which
causes the movement problems associated with the disease. Scientists still do not know
what causes the neurons to die.
An estimated **7 to 10 million** people around the world have Parkinson’s
disease, many of whom suffer from freezing of gait (FOG). During a **FOG episode**, a **patient’s feet are “glued” to the ground**, preventing them from moving forward despite their attempts.
FOG has a profound negative impact on health-related quality of life. People who suffer from FOG are often **depressed**, have an **increased risk of falling**, are likelier to be **confined to wheelchair use**, and have **restricted independence**.
**My Goal was not limited to detect freezing of gait (FOG) using data collected from a wearable 3D lower back sensors, but also to classify which event is triggering FoG to occur.** My work will help researchers better understand when and why FOG episodes occur. This will improve the ability of medical professionals to optimally evaluate, monitor, and ultimately, prevent FOG events.
