# Parkinson's Disease FOG

Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts
of the body controlled by the nerves. The most prominent signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s
disease occur when nerve cells in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain that controls movement,
become impaired and/or die. Normally, these nerve cells, or neurons, produce an important brain
chemical known as dopamine. When the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine,
which causes the movement problems associated with the disease. Scientists still do not know
what causes the neurons to die.

An estimated 7 to 10 million people around the world have Parkinson’s
disease, many of whom suffer from freezing of gait (FOG). During a FOG episode, a patient’s
feet are “glued” to the ground, preventing them from moving forward despite their attempts.
FOG has a profound negative impact on health-related quality of life. People who suffer from
FOG are often depressed, have an increased risk of falling, are likelier to be confined to
wheelchair use, and have restricted independence.

**My Goal was not limited to detect freezing of gait (FOG) using data collected from a wearable
3D lower back sensor, but also to classify which event is triggering FoG to occur.** My work will
help researchers better understand when and why FOG episodes occur. This will impro
